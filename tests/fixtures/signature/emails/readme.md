- '/P' contains all the original Example emails.
- '/Original' is the folder where all the original emails I select to mark.
- '/train' has all the marked emails used to get the '../tmp/extraction.data' to train the classifier.
- '/test' and '/test2' are folders for the test emails. the only difference is '/test' has many marked emails that contain Signature part, whilemost of the emails in '/test2' don't have a Signature part.
