These are the new wire approval requirements:

For Future Fundings:

EPI  - wires must be signed by Kevin Garland

ECR - wires must be signed by John Lavorato



Capital Calls and Facility Wires need to be signed by Joe Deffner


Please include a note on the wire on what the implications are if we do not fund the money.  This does not to be a long explanation.  It can be as simples as a contract default if we do not wire the money.
