Due to the recent developments at Enron, the ENhance luncheon scheduled for next week will be postponed until further notice.  Although this luncheon has been postponed, Enron recognizes the value and importance of the administrative assistant community, and will reschedule the launch of the ENhance program as soon as possible.  

ENhance Committee would like to thank all those that participated in the development of this important program.
