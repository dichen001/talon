Earlier today, FERC issued the attached order approving an extension of the=
 NYISO's Automated Mitigation Procedures (also known as the AMP or Circuit =
Breaker) through April 30, 2002, rather than until October 31 as had been s=
ought by the ISO. Enron had submitted comments opposing the ISO's request. =
FERC also directs the ISO to file a comprehensive mitigation proposal that =
addresses FERC's concerns with the AMP as well as FERC's concerns regarding=
 how the ISO's overall mitigation measures work together. This proposal is =
due by March 1, to be effective May 1.=20

FERC acknowledges two problems with the AMP that the NYISO has already comm=
itted to fix: limiting the mitigation to specific zones and hours that fail=
 the impact test, and exempting bids of less than 50 MW unless thee is a de=
monstrated  market power concern. In addition, FERC directs the ISO to work=
 with market participants to (1) examine whether the AMP may serve as a bar=
rier to entry for new generation, and whether such new generation should be=
 exempted from the AMP; (2) examine whether other energy limited resources,=
 including those constrained by environmental rules, should be exempted fro=
m or accommodated in the AMP. Currently, only hydro units are exempted beca=
use their volatile bids often reflect their opportunity costs, not market p=
ower. FERC believes this logic applies to all energy limited resources as w=
ell; (3) file a comprehensive mitigation proposal which also explains how t=
he AMP will work in conjunction with other mitigation measures already in e=
ffect or proposed, including the in-city mitigation  measures. FERC is conc=
erned here that that all the pieces may not fit together and there may be i=
nconsistencies and gaps; and (4) consider must-run  mitigation measures con=
sistent with ISO-NE and PJM. Again, FERC seems to be concerned here with tr=
ansmission constraints within NYC. (Note that the Con Ed distribution syste=
m is not secured by the ISO and this has been at the root of most of the ou=
t-of-merit calls in the City.)  Finally, FERC cautions the NYISO that it ex=
pects one mitigation plan for the Northeast as part of the RTO process, and=
 it encourages them to collaborate with PJM and ISO-NE in formulating its M=
arch 1 comprehensive mitigation plan.
