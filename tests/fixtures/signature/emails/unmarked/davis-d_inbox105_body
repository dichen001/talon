Attached is a draft set of principles for installed capacity that has been developed by the three northeast ISO staffs, and just distributed to market participants for review and comment. In NY, they will be discussed at our next regularly scheduled ICAP working group meeting (which I Chair) on Nov. 30. If anyone has concerns or comments regarding this draft, please let me know by the middle of next week so that I can discuss them with you before the meeting on the 30th. Thanks. Howard
